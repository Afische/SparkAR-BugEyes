Interactive Engineer Design Test - Adam Fischer

Software used:
Cinema4D
Spark AR

Process:
For this test I first loaded in the Spark AR default mask into Cinema4D as reference for eye placement.
I created two elongated eyeball models using a capsule primitive.
I optimized my models by limiting the poly count and creating rigs with minimum bones.
I adjusted the UVs and applied an eyeball material.
I then exported the models seperately as a glTF.

In Spark AR I loaded in my eye models.
I created a mask with an opaque material so the the eyes appear to be in the head. 
I created a Javascript file to create eyeball functionality.
When the head moves, the eyes wobble. When the mouth is opened, the eyes bulge.

Thoughts:
I only had two nights to complete this test and would liked to have pushed myself harder with more time.
I would have liked to create a simple game using cannon.js physics and will look into that for the future.
